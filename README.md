## Stacoverflow Fanatic Badge Earner

[Fanatic badge](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/83/fanatic) is one of the easiest to earn on stackoverflow.

It requires consistently logging on to s/o every day for a total of 100 days, that is a lot of discipline for a geeky Q/A site.

I tend to solve this with the attached ruby script.

## How to run
Install dependencies:
```bash
bundler install
```

Provide two environment variables:
- SO_EMAIL: the login email to the account
- SO_PASSWORD: the password for the account

Run the script:
```bash
./script.rb
```
